      <p>I love reading books becaus you get to learn so much by readind the story.I know that some peolpe dont like reading books and they just read the starting pages but when you read the whole book you get more interested on reading the.This happend to me once , one day i had to read any one book and expain it to the whole class,that was my project so i had to read the book fully so i read it for a few days then the interesting part came and i was really interested on reading the book day after day and then i realised that when i will read a book i will read it fully so that i get to know what really happend in the story.So after that i was a nerd in reading books and the first book that i read was "IQBAL" check that book out it is really interesting and i will give you a little hint about the story it is that the story is about a boy who fought against child labour.</p>
